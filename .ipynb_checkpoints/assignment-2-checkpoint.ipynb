    "#1.Explain the importance of functions.\n",
    "#Functions are fundamental building blocks in programming. They play a crucial role in structuring and organizing code, making it more readable, reusable, and maintainable. Here are some key points highlighting the importance of functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Modularity:\n",
    "#Functions break down complex problems into smaller, manageable units. Each function can perform a specific task, making it easier to understand and manage the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Reusability:\n",
    "#Functions allow you to write a piece of code once and reuse it multiple times throughout your program. This eliminates redundancy and reduces the likelihood of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Maintainability:\n",
    "#Functions make code more maintainable by isolating functionality. If a bug is found or a change is needed, you can update a single function without affecting other parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Readability:\n",
    "#Functions improve the readability of the code by providing a clear structure. Descriptive function names and docstrings help others understand the purpose and usage of each function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Abstraction:\n",
    "#Functions provide a level of abstraction. Users of a function do not need to know the implementation details; they only need to understand the inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Testing:\n",
    "#Functions facilitate testing. You can test each function independently to ensure it works correctly, leading to more reliable and robust programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Encapsulation:\n",
    "#Functions can encapsulate behavior. They can hide the internal workings and expose only the necessary interface, protecting the integrity of the data.\n"

    "#50.Why is encapsulation considered a pillar of object – oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#1. Data Protection and Integrity\n",
    "#Encapsulation helps protect an object's internal state by restricting direct access to its attributes. This ensures that the data can only be modified in controlled ways, typically through methods provided by the class. This prevents unauthorized or unintended modifications, preserving the integrity and consistency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Modularity and Maintainability\n",
    "#Encapsulation promotes modularity by separating an object's internal implementation from its external interface. This separation allows developers to modify the internal workings of a class without affecting code that depends on the class. As a result, the codebase becomes easier to maintain and evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Abstraction\n",
    "#Encapsulation supports the principle of abstraction by exposing only the essential features and hiding the unnecessary details. Users of the class interact with a simplified interface, making the code easier to understand and use. This abstraction allows developers to focus on high-level design without getting bogged down by implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Control and Flexibility\n",
    "#By controlling access to an object's data, encapsulation allows the class to enforce rules and constraints on the data. For example, a class can ensure that a balance attribute never becomes negative by only allowing valid withdrawals through a method. This control adds flexibility, as the class can evolve its rules and constraints without impacting external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. Reduced Complexity\n",
    "#Encapsulation helps manage complexity by creating well-defined boundaries between different parts of a program. Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior, reducing the interdependencies between classes. This leads to a more organized and manageable code structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. Enhanced Reusability\n",
    "#Encapsulated classes are more self-contained and can often be reused across different projects or parts of a program. Since the internal implementation is hidden, other parts of the program rely only on the public interface, making it easier to adapt the class for different uses.\n"

    "#Encapsulation in Python refers to the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. This concept allows the class to hide its internal implementation details from the outside world and only expose a controlled interface for interacting with its data. Property decorators in Python play a crucial role in implementing encapsulation by providing controlled access to class attributes.\n",
